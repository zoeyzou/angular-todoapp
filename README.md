# Angular - Todo App

This is my first angular project, mirroring the other todo app made by React ([link](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)).

# How to use

**Add**: Type in a todo item and press Enter, it will be in the todo list beneath it.

**Edit**: Click on the pen icon, the input field will come out and you can edit it. After editting, press enter to save it. NoteL: you need to click into the input field to save or quit (press ESC key).

**Delete**: Click the X icon to delete an item.

**Filter**: Below the list, there're three filters: all, active and completed. Click on any of them will lead you to the appointed category.

**Clear Complete**: Click on "Clear Complete" to clean up the list, which will delete all the completed items.
